## Description
This a very simple python application that is asking a hypothetical question to the user. The users input is then taken processed and a response returned. The question is, if you were given a dollar and put in an empty room with just a bed, How long would you stay provided every day you stay that dollar would double. Meaning:

Day | Amount($)
| --- | --- |
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 4
4 | 8

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone Repo 
* Git Pull Repo 
* Install Python3.7 or any version

Inside of folder where the module is located, type command in terminal: 

  * python3.7 doublerParadox.py \
   --or--
  * python{your version} doublerParadox.py

## Known Bugs
There is a bug where if someone was to input a value that is not a number, the function cannot handle it and will throw an error. There is code in place to handle input that isn't a number, but I can't figure out how to verify if it's a number or not.
